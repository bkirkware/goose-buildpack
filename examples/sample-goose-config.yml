  # Example skills configurations:
  #
  # Inline skill (embedded directly in config):
  # skills:
  #   - name: code-review
  #     description: Comprehensive code review checklist for pull requests
  #     content: |
  #       # Code Review Checklist
  #       When reviewing code, check each of these areas:
  #       ## Functionality
  #       - [ ] Code does what the PR description claims
  #       - [ ] Edge cases are handled
  #       ## Code Quality
  #       - [ ] Follows project style guide
  #       - [ ] No hardcoded values that should be configurable
  #
  # File-based skill (reads SKILL.md from a directory):
  # skills:
  #   - name: deployment
  #     path: .goose/skills/deployment
  #
  # Git-based skill (clones from repository):
  # skills:
  #   - name: company-standards
  #     source: https://github.com/org/goose-skills.git
  #     branch: main
  #     path: skills/company-standards

# Active configuration example:
# Uncomment to enable the developer extension
extensions:
  developer:
    enabled: true

# Example: Enable a simple inline skill for production deployment
# skills:
#   - name: production-deploy
#     description: Safe deployment procedure for production environment
#     content: |
#       # Production Deployment
#       ## Pre-deployment
#       1. Ensure all tests pass
#       2. Get approval from at least 2 reviewers
#       3. Notify #deployments channel
#       ## Deploy
#       1. Create release branch from main
#       2. Run ./gradlew build
#       3. Deploy to staging, verify, then production
